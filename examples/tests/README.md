# MuPDF.js tests

## Installing

`npm install`

## Running

To run all the tests do:

`npm run test`


To run a single test, then send the test file you want as a parameter, e.g.

`npm run test -- src/journal.test.ts`



## Note

These tests do not run with your local MuPDF JS!

Therefore ensure in your `package.json` `devDependencies` that you are targetting the release of MuPDF.js that you need to use.
